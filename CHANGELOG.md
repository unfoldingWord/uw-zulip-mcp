# Changelog

All notable changes to ZulipChat MCP are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Merged upstream v0.7.1** — Brings in the agent control plane (session-scoped agent tools, `ensure_agent_session`, `list_sessions`, `close_agent_session`), Claude Code plugin, explicit FastMCP task support for long-running tools, and lifespan-managed background services. All uW fork hardening (channel filtering, read-only mode, agent disabling, audit logging, configurable transport) is preserved. AFK mode tools are removed upstream; the session model replaces them.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Restored v0.7.x startup under FastMCP 3 by installing the task extra (`fastmcp[anthropic,tasks]`) and disabling accidental server-wide task advertisement. Reported by @jessealama in #10 and addressed by @jessealama's PR #11, with additional confirmation from @peteWT and @jpuritz in #12.
- Made MCP task support explicit and opt-in for long-running tools only: `teleport_chat`, `wait_for_response`, and `listen_events` now advertise optional background-task support while normal fast tools remain standard calls.
- Converted `teleport_chat(wait_for_reply=True)` and `wait_for_response` to async-safe implementations so task-enabled calls do not block the server event loop.
- Moved background service startup and shutdown into the FastMCP lifespan, giving the Zulip listener a managed teardown path instead of process-lifetime threads.

### Tests
- Added real FastMCP registration coverage for core and extended tools, including a regression guard that prevents reintroducing server-wide `tasks=True`.

### Docs
- Modernized `CLAUDE.md`: removed stale v0.4 import patterns, fixed the local connection-test snippet to use installed-package imports, documented the `register_tool` / `optional_background_task` pattern from `tools/registration.py`, the 20-core / 56-extended tool modes (`--extended-tools` / `ZULIPCHAT_EXTENDED_TOOLS=1`), and the three project skills under `.claude/skills/`.
- Switched GitHub releases to `gh release create --generate-notes`. `RELEASE.md` removed; `CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of release notes.
- `ROADMAP.md` v0.7.1 date corrected to 2026-05-11 to match `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Agent control plane** for session-scoped Claude Code workflows. New core tool `ensure_agent_session` and extended tools `list_sessions`, `close_agent_session`, backed by a stable agent profile registered via the rebuilt `register_agent`.
- **Claude Code plugin** at `integrations/claude-code/plugin/` with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, hook bridge, three skills (`zulipchat-session-operator`, `zulipchat-notifyme`, `zulipchat-loop`), and the `zulip-session-operator` subagent.
- **Standalone `.claude/` template** at `integrations/claude-code/.claude/` for users who want to vendor the integration into their own repo without the plugin format.
- **`zulipchat-mcp-hook` CLI** that bridges Claude Code lifecycle events (`SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `Notification idle_prompt`, `StopFailure`, `TaskCompleted`, `SessionEnd`) into the bound Zulip topic.
- **`zulipchat-mcp-integrate export --client claude-code`** subcommand to generate the plugin or standalone scaffold into a target directory, with bot-config and extended-tools modes.
- DuckDB tables `agent_profiles`, `agent_sessions`, `agent_requests`, `session_events`. Migration is additive; existing tables and rows are untouched.

### Changed
- `register_agent` now accepts optional `agent_name`, `owner_email`, `stream_name`, `topic_prefix`, `metadata` keyword arguments. Existing calls without arguments still work. The return shape is new: `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `agent_type`, `owner_email`, `stream`, `topic_prefix`.
- `agent_message`, `request_user_input`, and `wait_for_response` now operate session-scoped against the topic bound by `ensure_agent_session`. The previous channel-broadcast behavior is replaced.
- Hook commands in the Claude Code plugin invoke `uvx --from zulipchat-mcp zulipchat-mcp-hook` so the bridge resolves whether the package is installed persistently or run ephemerally.
- Setup wizard command corrected to `uvx --from zulipchat-mcp zulipchat-mcp-setup` across README, troubleshooting, installation, quick-start, and setup-wizard docs. (PR #9, credit: @odurif0)

### Removed
- AFK mode tools `enable_afk_mode`, `disable_afk_mode`, `get_afk_status`, and the merged `afk_mode` tool. The session model (`ensure_agent_session` plus `close_agent_session`) replaces them.

### Upgrading from 0.6.x
- DuckDB schema upgrade runs automatically on first start of v0.7.0. No manual migration is required.
- Scripts that called the AFK tools must be updated to the session model.
- Scripts that parsed the previous `register_agent` return keys must read from the new keys (`agent_id`, `stream`, `topic_prefix`).
- For the new Claude Code plugin, install via Claude Code's plugin command and ensure `~/.zuliprc` (and optionally `~/.zuliprc-bot`) exist. Hooks call `uvx --from zulipchat-mcp zulipchat-mcp-hook`, so no global package install is required.

## [0.7.0-uw] - 2026-03-19

unfoldingWord organizational fork. All changes are additive — upstream compatibility preserved.

### Added
- **Channel filtering (Johnny Decimal)** — Deterministic access control based on JD naming conventions. Channels filtered by `XX`/`XX.YY` prefix with area-range allowlists/denylists, individual overrides, and private channel exclusion. Enforced at client wrapper level across all access paths (stream listing, search, send, read, stream-ID tools). 60 dedicated tests.
- **Read-only mode** — `--read-only` flag / `ZULIPCHAT_READ_ONLY=true`. Write tools are not registered at all, not just blocked.
- **Agent disabling** — `--disable-agents` flag / `ZULIPCHAT_DISABLE_AGENTS=true`. Agent tools not registered, background services not started.
- **DM and private channel exclusion** — `ZULIPCHAT_EXCLUDE_DMS` and `ZULIPCHAT_EXCLUDE_PRIVATE` with safe defaults (both excluded).
- **Audit logging** — Structured JSON audit trail of tool invocations and channel access. Serialized via `json.dumps` (injection-safe). Configurable output file and log level. Never logs message content.
- **Startup privacy notice** — Data flow warning on stderr at server start, summarizing active filter configuration. Suppressible with `ZULIPCHAT_QUIET=true`.
- **Configurable cache TTLs** — `ZULIPCHAT_CACHE_TTL_MESSAGES`, `ZULIPCHAT_CACHE_TTL_STREAMS`, `ZULIPCHAT_CACHE_TTL_USERS` env vars.
- **Configurable fuzzy match cutoff** — `ZULIPCHAT_FUZZY_MATCH_CUTOFF` (clamped to 0.0-1.0).
- **Configurable agent timeout** — `ZULIPCHAT_AGENT_TIMEOUT` env var with progress logging every 30s and uW branded progress indicator for TTY sessions.
- **Stream metadata index** — ID-to-name/privacy mapping enables consistent enforcement across both name-based and ID-based access paths.
- **Blocked-by-policy counters** — WARNING-level logging on every denied access with `get_blocked_counts()` for observability.
- **Security scanning in CI** — Bandit step added to GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Bot credential field validation** — `has_bot_credentials()` validates zuliprc contents (email, key, site), not just file existence.
- **Fail-closed option for unknown stream IDs** — `ZULIPCHAT_DENY_UNKNOWN_STREAM_IDS=true`.

### Fixed
- **Stream ID bypass** — Tools operating on stream IDs (get_stream_topics, get_subscribers) now check the channel filter via stream metadata index.
- **Private channel enforcement gap** — `exclude_private` now enforced consistently on send, read, and message filter paths via `is_channel_allowed_with_privacy()`.
- **Silent failure paths** — Bare `pass` in except blocks replaced with `logger.warning()` in event_management, service_manager, and agent_tracker.
- **Env config crash on invalid values** — `parse_area_ranges()` raises descriptive `ValueError`; cache TTL and fuzzy cutoff env vars degrade gracefully with warnings.
- **Audit log injection** — All audit event fields serialized via `json.dumps` instead of string interpolation.
- **Progress indicator cursor leak** — `finally` block guarantees cursor restore on exceptions.
- **Duplicate audit handlers** — `init_audit_logging()` is idempotent.
- **Lint/type issues** — All files pass ruff and mypy.
- **Import ordering** — Fixed logger placement in agent_tracker.py and event_management.py.

### Changed
- **Tool registration refactored** — `register_core_tools()` and `register_extended_tools()` accept `read_only` and `disable_agents` parameters.
- **CI triggers** — Workflow now runs on `develop` branch PRs (in addition to `main`).
- **Dependencies updated** — 77 packages updated including fastmcp 3.0.2→3.1.1, duckdb 1.3.2→1.5.0, pydantic 2.11→2.12, zulip 0.9.0→0.9.1.

### Tests
- 651 tests total (up from 611 in upstream v0.6.2)
- 60 channel filter tests (prefix parsing, area ranges, include/exclude, stream ID enforcement, privacy-aware checks, realistic deployment config)
- 8 audit logging tests (structured output, injection safety, idempotency)
- 12 cache env config tests (valid/invalid/boundary values)
- 5 bot validation tests

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Critical: Rate limit exhaustion** — Message listener was hardcoded to start on every server boot, long-polling Zulip's `/events` endpoint regardless of the `--enable-listener` flag. Multiple MCP client sessions would all poll simultaneously, exhausting the per-user rate limit. Listener is now off by default and lazy-started only when an agent tool that needs it is invoked. (PR #8, credit: @klutchell)
- **Tight-loop on API errors** — When the listener received a 429 or other error response, it returned an empty list and immediately retried with no delay, generating thousands of requests per minute. Now returns a sentinel on error and applies exponential backoff (2s base, 120s cap).
- **Stale DuckDB lock after unclean shutdown** — When a server process died without closing the database, the WAL file persisted and blocked all new connections permanently. The database layer now extracts the locking PID from DuckDB's error message, checks if the process is alive, and removes the stale WAL file if the process is dead. (Fixes #7, reported by: @JaimeCernuda)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- `zulipchat-mcp-integrate` CLI for generating copy-paste integration snippets across MCP clients.
- Integration package templates under `integrations/` for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode, VS Code/Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, and generic MCP clients.
- Automated release preflight checklist: `scripts/release_preflight.py`.
- Automated pre-release smoke runner: `scripts/pre_release_smoke.sh`.
- New setup wizard and integration docs: `docs/user-guide/setup-wizard.md`, `docs/integrations/*`.

### Changed
- Setup wizard (`zulipchat-mcp-setup`) now supports core vs extended tool mode, additional client targets, and config-file output paths.
- Publish workflow hardened with stricter version checks and wheel-installed entrypoint smoke tests before PyPI publish.
- Documentation refreshed and expanded for v0.6.x across user guide, API reference, integration pages, security/support/community docs, and contributor guides.
- Packaging metadata and source distribution contents aligned with public docs/integrations assets.

### Fixed
- `--debug` now correctly enables DEBUG-level structured logging in `zulipchat-mcp`.
- Setup wizard exits cleanly in non-interactive terminals and better prioritizes user vs bot zuliprc selection defaults.
- Release smoke script now installs the exact wheel for the target version, avoiding multi-wheel conflicts in `dist/`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Two-tier tool registration**: Default mode registers 19 core tools (~87% token reduction); `--extended-tools` flag or `ZULIPCHAT_EXTENDED_TOOLS=1` enables full set (~55 tools)
- **7 merged tools**: `manage_message_flags` (replaces 7 flag tools), `get_user` (replaces by-id + by-email), `manage_user_mute`, `toggle_reaction`, `manage_task`, `afk_mode`, `manage_scheduled_message`
- **CLI**: Added `--extended-tools` argument to `server.py`
- **Concise descriptions**: Core and extended tool descriptions optimized for token efficiency

### Removed
- **events.py stub**: Dead code that delegated to agents.py removed
- **Legacy registration path**: `server.py` no longer calls individual `register_*_tools()` functions; uses `register_core_tools()` / `register_extended_tools()` instead

### Added
- `register_core_tools()` and `register_extended_tools()` in `tools/__init__.py`
- `tests/tools/test_tool_tiers.py`: 36 tests covering registration counts, merged tool dispatch, error paths

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **CI fully green**: Resolved all CI failures across Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 — 10 mypy errors, 1 test failure, 2 ruff lint errors
- **Null credential guards**: Added validation in `identity.py` and `scheduler.py` to fail fast on missing credentials instead of passing `None`
- **Test compatibility**: Fixed enum `str()` rendering difference between Python 3.10 and 3.11+ in narrow filter tests
- **Type annotations**: Added missing return types in `config.py`, type annotation for `database.py` singleton flag

### Added
- **Auto-publish workflow**: `publish.yml` builds and uploads to PyPI via trusted publisher when a GitHub release is published
- **Issue templates**: Bug report and feature request templates with structured fields
- **PR template**: Checklist matching CONTRIBUTING.md standards
- **Release checklist**: `RELEASING.md` with step-by-step release runbook
- **Repo discoverability**: GitHub Discussions enabled, topics added, homepage set to PyPI

### Changed
- **Agent guides updated**: CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md now codify release process, open-source community practices, and correct coverage gate (60%, not 85%)
- **Tool counts corrected**: README and RELEASE.md now match actual registered tools (Messaging: 16, System: 5, Total: 67)
- **Labels**: Added project-specific labels (`community`, `fastmcp`, `mcp-tools`, `dependencies`, `breaking-change`, `needs-triage`) and retroactively labeled all issues/PRs
- **bump_version.py**: Fixed stale POLISHING.md reference, now targets RELEASE.md

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Teleport-Chat** (`teleport_chat` tool): Bidirectional agent-human messaging via Zulip DMs and channels. Bot identity for private back-channel; user identity for all org-facing actions. Supports fuzzy name resolution and optional wait-for-reply
- **Fuzzy User Resolution** (`resolve_user` tool): Resolve display names to Zulip emails with fuzzy matching — "Jaime" just works without knowing the formal email
- **Always-On Message Listener**: Listener runs automatically on startup (no longer gated behind `--enable-listener`). Receives all messages (DMs + streams), not just Agents-Channel
- **Queue State Persistence**: Listener queue ID and last_event_id survive restarts via `listener_state` DB table
- **AFK Auto-Return**: `auto_return_at` is now computed from `hours` parameter and enforced — AFK mode expires as expected
- **Cache Warmup**: User and stream caches pre-populated on server startup for instant fuzzy resolution

### Fixed
- **`poll_agent_events` always empty**: `_process_message` returned early when no `request_id` matched, never inserting into `agent_events`. Now always stores events
- **Listener missed DMs**: Event queue was narrowed to Agents-Channel only. Removed narrow — bot now receives all visible messages
- **AFK `auto_return_at` never set**: `set_afk_state` hardcoded `NULL`. Now computes expiry from hours
- **Zulip display vs delivery email mismatch**: Added `is_same_user()` to `UserCache` to correctly match `user12345@org.zulipchat.com` against `name@university.edu`

### Changed
- `--enable-listener` flag kept for backward compat but listener is now always-on
- `ServiceManager` always starts regardless of flag or AFK state

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **FastMCP 3.0 Upgrade**: Replaced removed `on_duplicate_tools/resources/prompts` and `include_fastmcp_meta` constructor kwargs with `on_duplicate="warn"` (Issue #4)
- **File Download URLs**: Normalized `/user_uploads/` paths to full `https://` URLs and resolved auth by identity (Issue #3)
- **Broken Test Suite**: Fixed 5 test files with missing mock patches, stale DB API references, and syntax errors (520 tests passing)

### Changed
- Pinned `fastmcp[anthropic]>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-22

### Changed

- **Wildcard Search**: Fixed wildcard query `*` returning empty results
- **Python 3.12+**: Fixed `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings

### Improved
- **Test Coverage**: Increased from 66% to 69% (484 tests, 0 warnings)

---

- **Anthropic Sampling Handler**: Fallback handler for LLM analytics when MCP sampling unavailable
- **249 New Tests**: Comprehensive test suite from Gemini QA audit (411 total tests)
- **Emoji Registry**: Approved emoji validation for agent reactions (`src/zulipchat_mcp/core/emoji_registry.py`)

### Changed
- **Version Reset**: Moved from 2.5.x to 0.4.x versioning scheme
- **MCP Spec Compliance**: Improved sampling, emoji registry, and error messages
