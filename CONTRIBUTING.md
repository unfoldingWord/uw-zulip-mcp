# Contributing to ZulipChat MCP

Thanks for contributing. This guide is optimized for fast, low-friction contributions.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akougkas/zulipchat-mcp.git
cd zulipchat-mcp
uv sync
```

Run locally:

```bash
uv run zulipchat-mcp --zulip-config-file ~/.zuliprc
```

## Quality gates

Run before opening a PR:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
changed_py=$(git diff --name-only -- '*.py')
[ -z "$changed_py" ] || uv run black --check $changed_py
uv run mypy src
```

Coverage gate is `60%`.

If your PR touches packaging, dependencies, FastMCP server construction, tool
registration, background tasks, lifespan handling, or CLI startup, also run:

```bash
uv build
scripts/pre_release_smoke.sh --version X.Y.Z --allow-dirty
```

Use the package version from `pyproject.toml` for `X.Y.Z`. This smoke starts the
MCP stdio server with fake credentials, lists tools, and calls `server_info`; it
does not contact a real Zulip server.

## Contribution rules

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- Keep changes focused and reviewable.
- Update docs when behavior or commands change.
- Do not commit secrets.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Problem and solution are clearly stated
- [ ] Tests and checks pass locally
- [ ] Startup or packaging changes include MCP stdio smoke results
- [ ] Docs are updated when needed
- [ ] No credentials or private data in commits

## Community workflow

- Triage labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `community`, `needs-triage`
- Prefer merging community fixes instead of reimplementing in parallel.
- After release, comment on fixed issues with the released version.
